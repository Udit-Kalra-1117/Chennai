# Chennai - House Price Prediction

This repository containes the mini project done by me and my classmates in a group of 4 for the Data Mining and Analytics subject during my Sem - 6.

The dataset used is taken from Kaggle.
The dataset contains 7109 rows along with 22 columns.
The steps undertaken for prediciting a house price in a particular area in Chennai using the above dataset are:

  **1. Data Cleaning:** At this stage null values were removed and the entries in the dataset were made uniform.

  **2. Exploratory Data Analysis:** The relationship between the various columns with each other was found and seen using various maps like Heatmap, Piechart, Countplot, Histogram, Distance-plot, Scatter-plot, Barplot. These plots helped me to show relationship between numerical columns and categorical columns.

  **3. Encoding the Data:** The two methods of encoding the data used are One-Hot Encoder and Label Encoder. After encoding and finding the relationship between the columns the least relatable columns or the negligibly affecting columns were removed.

  **4. Scaling the Data:** The data points were fiited into training and testing sets by scaling them in three different ways viz.; Normal scaling, Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaling.

  **5. Prediciting the Prices:** The Machine Learning models used for predicting the house prices are; Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XG Boost Regressor and Voting Regressor
